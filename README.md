# Zade's Wallpaper

> Draw coloured shapes on your wallpaper

## About

My custom android live wallpaper.

> Zade's wallpaper spawns lets you draw with shapes on your background and spawns random shapes when you're not drawing.
> It's very customisable - every feature can be turned on or off, you can change the background colour, shape colour, shape type, and many other things.

I followed [this tutorial](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/AndroidLiveWallpaper/article.html) to get the basics going, then took it on my own from there.
