Zade's wallpaper lets you draw with shapes on your background, and spawns random shapes when you're not drawing.

It's very customisable - every feature can be turned on or off, and you can change the background colour and shape colour, select shape types, and much more.

Features:
- Very customisable
- Supports Material 3 icon theming
- Amoled black option
- Multi-touch support
